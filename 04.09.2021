        "description": "\"A half-dozen residents of Sky Ranch, a much older subdivision near 112th and Holdrege, can park their airplanes in hangars built into their basements — and there’s a runway a stone’s throw away...Beechcraft Road is just off Cessna Lane, not far from Cessna Circle and Piper Way.  You get the picture. Every street in the 28-house subdivision, built around 1970, is named after a popular aircraft model. Six houses have hangars.\"",
