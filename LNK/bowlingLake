The early history of Bowling Lake is an episode of domestic Cold War history. 
In the early 1970s, Bowling Lake was in bleak shape. The recreational site had few visitors, and dead fish washed ashore, the smell of which ¬– one newspaper reported – “wafted to Arnold Heights residents.” Such scenes were a far cry from the carnival-esque dedication ceremony that brought Ms. Nebraska and a Western movie star to Bowling Lake. Indeed, fishing, swimming, and waterskiing had been banned at the park by the 1970s.  
Finally, after persistent petitioning from Arnold Heights residents, Bowling Lake re-opened to the public in 1975 with the help of the city of Lincoln Parks and Recreation Department.
