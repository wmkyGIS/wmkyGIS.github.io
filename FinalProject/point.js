(LJS, 03 Oct. 1946) – 70 singles students were already living in their quarters, despite the capacity being 250 persons.

Polio was spreading in Huskerville. By the end of the year, two Huskerville children perished and 18 residents were paralyzed. It was not until 1956 that researchers from the University of Nebraska determined that the Huskerville polio outbreak was not spread from person-to-person. Instead, the cause was back-siphonage from improper toilet repairs. It was around the same time in the mid-1950s that Huskerville’s population steadily declined. (Breanna Fanta, “1952 Huskerville Polio Outbreak,” History Nebraska)  – Lincoln Air Force Base was fully de-activated by 1968 when the Air Force negotiated the breaking of the 99-year contract with the City of Lincoln. The Lincoln Airport Authority took control of the base in 1970. In 1971, the Arnold Heights housing area was open to the public. ",

The Omaha-San Francisco leg of the transcontinental route was opened by Pilot Buck Heforn the following September. Daytime airmail service from New York to San Francisco began on September 8, 1920 and the first shipment from the east was flown into Omaha by James Murray. Although the early airmail flights took place during daylight hours, the feasibility of night flying was soon explored. On February 22, 1921, Jack Knight took off from the North Platte, Nebraska, airfield on the first night airmail flight in the United States. He landed here at Ak-Sar-Ben Field before continuing on to Chicago. The efforts of these pioneer aviators led to the inauguration, on July 1, 1924, of day-night airmail service from coast to coast. In September 1974 the Air Mail Pioneers of America met in Omaha to observe the 50th Anniversary of this significant event in aviation history.\"",
