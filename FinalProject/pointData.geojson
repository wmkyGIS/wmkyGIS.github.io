Among the various military exercises, servicemen practiced dropping (fake) bombs from flying airplanes.

The trio barnstormed in surrounding states, performed in air shows, repaired airplanes, and taught other aviation-minded Lincolnites how to fly. Harriet Long Stotts was one of those students. She worked for Harding, Zook, and Bahl in 1920. Stotts also took flying lessons from Bahl, placing her in contention for perhaps being Nebraska's first female pilot. The company, headed by Lt. Errold Bahl, also advertised flying lessons in The Daily Nebraskan, the University’s newspaper. Bahl and his partners designed and built the Lark monoplane, and advertised it as an airplane for the “average man.” In May 1920, Bahl even took Executive Dean of the University of Nebraska on an aerial campus tour.",

        "description": "Nebraska Aircraft Corporation – a main competitor of Harding, Zook, and Bahl – was created by three businessmen in 1919. In an effort to create powerful yet reliant planes, the owners purchase a large stockpile of WWI-surplus airplanes and engines. The first of these airplanes was manufactured in the Industrial Arts Building on the old Nebraska State Fairgrounds. By 1921, the businessmen fell behind on their loan payments. Rumor suggests that one of the founders fled to Mexico with the company's assets. Consequently, creditors tapped a local salesman, Ray Page, to take control of the company in 1922 - renaming it Lincoln Standard Aircraft Company.  In addition to producing planes, Lincoln Standard also provided flying lessons. Its most famous student was Charles Lindbergh, who enrolled at the school in 1922 and first learned to fly, parachute, and barnstorm in Lincoln. Later in the decade, the schooling branch of Lincoln Standard was purchased by E.J. Sias, who re-named it the Lincoln Airplane and Flying School while Lincoln Standard remained under the supervision of Page.   On March 30, 1930, the Lincoln Airplane and Flying School was officially approved by the US Department of Commerce: Aeronautics Branch. The Lincoln Airplane and Flying School operated out of two locations: the recently constructed municipal airport housed the flight training program, while mechanics training took place at the company’s headquarters in downtown Lincoln at 2409 ‘O’ Street). The school briefly provided flight instruction to army cadets in 1939, before the Army Air Corps, “deterred by a particularly harsh Nebraska winter,” opted to move the training program to Lakeland, Florida, the following fall. The facility closed in 1945, but the mantle of flight instruction in Lincoln was quickly taken up by other aviation-minded entrepreneurs.  Page sold Lincoln Standard in 1929 to a group of Omaha investors. Unfortunately, the Great Depression compounded the increase in government flying regulations prompted the company to move operations out of Lincoln to Kansas City.",

        "description": "Ak-Sar-Ben Field, whose hangars were located on the southeastern corner of these grounds, was used extensively during the early development of U.S. Postal Air Mail Service. Ray Benedict landed here with the first airmail from Chicago on May 15, 1920 and William DeWald piloted the return flight the same day. The Omaha-San Francisco leg of the transcontinental route was opened by Pilot Buck Heforn the following September. Daytime airmail service from New York to San Francisco began on September 8, 1920 and the first shipment from the east was flown into Omaha by James Murray. Although the early airmail flights took place during daylight hours, the feasibility of night flying was soon explored. On February 22, 1921, Jack Knight took off from the North Platte, Nebraska, airfield on the first night airmail flight in the United States. He landed here at Ak-Sar-Ben Field before continuing on to Chicago. The efforts of these pioneer aviators led to the inauguration, on July 1, 1924, of day-night airmail service from coast to coast. In September 1974 the Air Mail Pioneers of America met in Omaha to observe the 50th Anniversary of this significant event in aviation history.",

        "description": "Huskerville started as a Federal Public Housing Authority project immediately after World War II to house military veterans ¬– many of whom were University of Nebraska students – near the Lincoln Army Airfield. Huskerville boasted its own private bus route, cafeteria, post office, grocery store, and movie theater among other social outlets.  The neighborhood could accommodate single men and married men with families. 250 units were converted from World War II-era officer quarters and made available to single men with rent set at $10 per month.    When the project first commenced, nearly 700 families applied to live in one of Huskerville’s 253 family units. These units were converted from the former base hospital. Perhaps what attracted such a volume of applicants was the persistent advertising promising “much better housing situation than most universities…with its steam heat, hot running water and hard wood floors,” or the “good food at low cost” at the Huskerville cafeteria, or the steady bus service between the neighborhood and campus, or the availability of a children’s daycare to aid working parents.  In 1952, residents of Huskerville were perplexed and frightened by a string of paralyzations and illness within their community. Polio was spreading in Huskerville. By the end of the year, two Huskerville children perished and 18 residents were paralyzed. It was not until 1956 that researchers from the University of Nebraska determined that the Huskerville polio outbreak was not spread from person-to-person. Instead, the cause was back-siphonage from improper toilet repairs. It was around the same time in the mid-1950s that Huskerville’s population steadily declined.  Huskerville was torn down around 1966 and, according to some newspapers, a housing crisis for married Huskers ensued. The land, as a University-affiliated housing enclave, was taken over by the Lincoln Airport Authority in the 1970s after the de-activation of the Lincoln Air Force Base in the late-1960s. Today, Huskerville is still a populated area of northwest Lincoln where community development and airport business are conducted side-by-side.",

One major activity at these bases with bombardment practice, similar to the exercises near the Nebraska State Fairgrounds only a few decades before. Despite being officially de-activated in 1945, the area still served in some military-related capacity between throughout the late 1940s and early 1950s. After heavy post-war demobilization, the Korean War sparked an urgent need to reactivate the Lincoln Army Airfield and convert it into the Lincoln Air Force Base (LAFB) as well as a Strategic Air Command bomber base.   In the early 1950s, the United States Air Force reactivated the former Lincoln Army Airfield. Oak Creek was diverted and a two-mile-long runway was built to accommodate military jets. Other infrastructural improvements were made to the now-outdated airfield. New barracks, mess halls, recreation facilities, warehouses, and weapons bunkers each signaled in their own way that the Cold War had come to Lincoln.  KUON, a Lincoln television station, document these projects along with other happenings at LAFB with a weekly show that premiered in 1958 entitled, “Wings Over Lincoln.” The base primarily housed particular types of bombers that would be deployed in the event of a nuclear attack, a program known as “nuclear deterrence.” In the 1960s, Lincoln witnessed a new level of Cold War omnipresence, even as commercial air traffic continued to flow out of Lincoln Municipal Airport. Throughout southeastern Nebraska, supersonic nuclear defense missiles were installed in towns surrounding Lincoln.   For more information about the dynamic social life in and around LAFB, see Bowling Lake and Huskerville. On April 16, 2021, the governor of Nebraska temporarily “reopened” the Lincoln Air Force Base to house the 55th Wing while the outfit’s traditional home, Offutt Air Force Base, undergoes a multi-million-dollar runway renovation. It was the latest in a long relationship between the Lincoln Airport Authority, the Nebraska Air National Guard, and Offutt Air Force Base in the 21st century.",
